            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is one main repository for every project file. It helps to eliminate the file sharing problem that can occur between team members, or if you want to recover past versions of a file without having to save the file over and over again. Any individual, or team member, can work on files at any given point and be able to not only save the current version of the file but be able to go back and look at all the past changes made as well. This helps remove chaos and makes it simpler for members to work together simultaneously.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system, or better referred to as VCS, is a system made by programmers to help remove errors and make an easy way for individuals, or team members to access data. Version control systems use revision control, which is in a large database which keeps al of the changes made to a file. VCS automatically recalls who changed the files, when they were changed, and what changed about them. On a VCS files cannot be overwritten and it allows you to revert back to the original or an older version of any file. The common repository within the VCS holds all the files from the original to the latest.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a place where things can either be made, or stored. In version control systems, a repository is made to save the status of any file or project. Two different kinds of repository’s can be used with version control systems, local repository or remote repository. In a sense, both repository’s do essentially the same job. However, a remote repository is used on a remote server that can be shared with other individuals or team members. While, a local repository is only used on a local computer of which one individual has access to all of the versions of the files.

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is a free and an open source. Git can handle files or projects stemming from very small to very large. Git has its own repository that allows every user to have a complete copy at their fingertips. As a distributed version control system, everything is found locally within the system. When file sharing with team members, Git will prevent unintentional overwrites on all of its shared repository’s. Typically, Git is known for its speed and simple design. It has a very simple design and is easy to navigate for beginners but also has complex features that are usefully for experienced users.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has extremely easy commands to remember, there are five basic commands, and three remote commands all of which contain less than 5 words each. The basic Git commands are as follows: git init, git add –all, git commit –am ‘initial commit’, git log, and git status. While the remote commands are as follows: git remote, git pull, and git push. With Git commands there are also three basic commands to follow, step one is add, step two is commit, and step three is push. Within git you can pull, fetch or merge any information within any file or project on the repository.
